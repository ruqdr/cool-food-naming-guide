# Cool Food Naming Guide

## Project Purpose
This collaborative, open-source project aims to create a "Creative Healthy Food Naming Guide" – a living resource for school administrators, parents, and food service managers seeking to make healthy options more appealing to children. By using catchy, humorous, and unique names, we can influence consumer behavior towards healthier eating habits.

## Professor Persona
This project is led by Dr. **Brandon "Brand" Wright**, a marketing professor and expert in food branding. With extensive research on the use of catchy and unique names to influence consumer behavior towards healthy eating, Dr. Wright has developed strategies to improve healthy eating habits in schools and other public spaces. He champions the use of humor and creativity to make healthy food options more appealing to children and has published studies on the effectiveness of unusual and catchy names in promoting healthy eating. As a thought leader in food marketing, he is a sought‑after speaker and consultant.
